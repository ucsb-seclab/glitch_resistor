# STM32 Basic Firmware Example
This firmware does the bare minimum to board the board and communicate over UART

## Contents
* `patch_makefile.sh` - Portable script that will patch the default Makefile generated by CubeMX to change the build environment to clang, enabling GlitchResistor
* `build.sh` - Portable script that will build the firmware with _all_ of our defenses enabled
* `build_all.sh` - Portable script that will the firmware in every configuration, i.e., no instrumentation, once with each of the defenses enabled individually, and once with all of the defenses enabled.  The resulting files are stored in `output`
* `get_stats.sh` - A simple script to retrieve stats from the `output` of `build_all.sh`
* `boot_times.py` - This script is used to automate runtime testing.  It will flash the board, boot it, and read out timing values over the serial interface.
```bash
python boot_times.py
```
* `gdb_connect.sh` - Portable script that will connect to the board and load the firmware using `st-util`
* `flash_firmware.sh` - Portable script to flash the firmward to the board using `st-flash`
