# Maximum Hamming Distance

This program should use our Reed-Solomon code implementation to check just how far away all of our possibly generated values will be (we support 65,536 values by default)

The problem of creating numbers with a maximum pairwise hamming distance is an open problem in mathematics: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/891528/generating-a-binary-code-with-maximized-hamming-distance?rq=1
